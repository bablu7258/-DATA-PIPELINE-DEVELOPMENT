##This Python script is an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline designed for automated data preprocessing. It reads raw data from a CSV file, applies necessary transformations, and saves the cleaned dataset for further analysis. The script uses Pandas for data manipulation and Scikit-Learn for preprocessing tasks such as handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and scaling numerical features. The load_data function reads the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame, while the preprocess_data function identifies numerical and categorical columns. For numerical features, it applies imputation (replacing missing values with the mean) and scaling (using StandardScaler). For categorical features, it fills missing values with the most frequent category and encodes them using OneHotEncoder, ensuring that all categorical variables are converted into numerical form. These transformations are combined using ColumnTransformer, allowing the preprocessing steps to be applied efficiently. The processed data is then converted back into a Pandas DataFrame and saved using the save_data function. The script is structured to run as a standalone program, where it reads from "data/raw_data.csv", processes the data, and outputs "data/processed_data.csv". This ETL pipeline is particularly useful for data scientists, machine learning engineers, and analysts who need to clean and prepare data before training models. It can be applied in various fields, such as finance, healthcare, e-commerce, and social sciences, where structured data requires preprocessing before analysis. The pipeline ensures data consistency, improves model performance, and automates repetitive preprocessing tasks, making it ideal for machine learning workflows and business intelligence applications.
